ðŸ‘— Fashion-MNIST Classification

A deep learning project using TensorFlow/Keras to classify clothing images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
The goal is to train a model that recognizes fashion items such as T-shirts, sneakers, and bags with high accuracy.

ðŸ§¥ Fashion-MNIST Dataset

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article imagesâ€”consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each example is a 28Ã—28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 fashion categories.

It is a drop-in replacement for MNIST (handwritten digits), but more challenging and realistic for computer vision tasks.
